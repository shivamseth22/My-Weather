# Weather App

This is a simple weather app built using Vite and React. It allows users to view weather details for different cities, including city name, state, temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and current weather conditions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building the App

To build the app for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of the app in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the weather app by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. Enter the name of the city for which you want to see the weather details, and the app will display the relevant information.

## Features

- View weather details for different cities
